A printout exactly as you planned!

I decided to create a more functional library than the popular Adafruit library.
Not all printer functions are currently supported as barecode, bitmap and user-definied character.

Less errors, easier start for all - just use!

I will be grateful for feedback.

Some features may not work on the older firmware.
